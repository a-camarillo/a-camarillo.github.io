# About Me

I am a recent graduate from California State University, Long Beach pursuing a career in data science. My current projects focus primarily on data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. 

# Projects

### [League of Legends Discord Bot](../projects/discord_bot.html)
Created a discord bot which connects to the Riot API and collects data for players. Current functions allow users to command the bot to retrieve player rank, statistics, and a visual displaying recent characters played with wins and losses, resepectively.

### [NFL Running Backs Interactive Visualization](../projects/nfl_running_backs.html)
This project takes the statistics of the top 50 rushers(in total rush yards) for the 2019 NFL season and creates an interactive visualization dashboard using the Python Framework Dash by Plotly. Inspiration for this project came when I watched Derrick Henry's electric performance against the Patriots in the Wild Card Round of the NFL Playoffs and became curious to see his season leading up to his rushing title.
