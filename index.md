# About Me

I am a recent mechanical engineering graduate from California State University, Long Beach pursuing a career in data analytics. My current projects focus primarily on data collection and visualization.

# SQL 

### [MySQL Scripts](../projects/sql/sql_scripts.html)
Some queries I have done for online challenges to learn and practice working with SQL

# Projects

### [Spotify Regression](../projects/spotify_regression/spotify_regression.html)
Created a recommendation playlist to explore music beyond my normal scope of listening which resulted in my finding of 19 new songs outside the genres I normally listen. Performed analysis of distributions and chi-squared tests for measuring preferences among key features then used logistic regression to predict the tracks in the playlist

### [League of Legends Discord Bot](../projects/discord-bot/discord_bot.html)
Created a discord bot which connects to the Riot API and collects data for players. Current functions allow users to command the bot to retrieve player rank, statistics, and a visual displaying recent characters played with wins and losses, resepectively.

### [NFL Running Backs Interactive Visualization](../projects/nfl-viz/nfl_running_backs.html)
Scraped statistics from NFL.com for the top 50 rushers, in total rush yards, for the 2019 season and used the python framework Dash by Plotly to create an interactive visualization. The visualization features a scatter plot of all players rush attempts versus yards gained week-by-week and a line graph displaying individual player's rushing performances over the season. 

### [Nutrition Analysis](../projects/nutrition_analysis/nutrition_analysis.html)
Collected nutrition data from household food items and fast food items I commonly consume. Visualized carbohyrdates, fats, and protein to see how individual items compared to each other and how they affect my personal dietary needs.

### [California AP Scores Visualization](../projects/california_ap/ap_viz.html)
Gathered data of California AP scores from [data.world](https://data.world) for the years 1999-2016. Using excel, cleaned individual worksheet files and combined them into one file, then used Tableau to create a chloropleth map which displays percentage of AP exams passed per county in California.
