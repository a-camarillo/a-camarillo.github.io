# NFL Running Backs Interactive Visualization

### Code for this project can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/a-camarillo/NFL-running-backs-2019)

Interactive features include displaying player name with their respective yards and attempts on hover, as well as, a slider tool to change the week.

Clicking on a player's point will display their weekly rushing performances over the entire season. Weeks without a point represent a bye for that player whereas a point with 0 indicates the player did not gain any yards due to injury, poor performance, being benched, et cetera.
